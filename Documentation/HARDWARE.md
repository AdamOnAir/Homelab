# Hardware

The key component of my homelab is a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
It does not have any soldered GPIO pins or HATs.

## What I plan to buy

- [Heatsink for Pi Zero](https://www.pishop.ca/product/aluminum-heatsink-for-raspberry-pi-zero/)
- [Pimoroni VGA demo](https://www.pishop.ca/product/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base/)

## Cases

I don't need one, although it would be cool.
