# Hardware
The key component of my homelab is a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
It does not have any soldered GPIO pins or HATs.

## What I plan to buy
- Waveshare Pi Zero 3b Adapter
- Heatsink for SoC
- Pico LCD Screen
- GPIO Pins for Raspberry Pi Zero
- Soldering Iron
- Zero LCD Screen

## Material
I have the Pi Zero, that has connected to it a powered USB hub that has individual switch USB ports.

Hub Content : 
- Pi Pico H(see the [pico.md](pico.md) file)
- Printer
- Keyboard sometimes

## Tower
I have a tower with 3 floors. To understand, see [this image](../Images/)
- Floor 1 : Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Floor 2 : Power Bank
- Floor 3 : Pi Pico H
