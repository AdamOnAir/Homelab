# Hardware

The key component of my homelab is a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
It does not have any soldered GPIO pins or HATs.

## What I plan to buy

- Waveshare Pi Zero 3b Adapter
- Breadboard
- Heatsink for SoC
- [Pimoroni VGA demo]
- GPIO Pins for Raspberry Pi Zero
- Soldering Iron(40W)

## Material

I have the Pi Zero, that has connected to it a powered USB hub that has individual switch USB ports.
