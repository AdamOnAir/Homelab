# The Pi Pico H
The Pi Pico H, in my case, only display the output of [sysinfo.py](../Scripts/sysinfo.py) on the LCD screen.

## How to  do it ?
Currently, I don't have any ideas at all. The question is [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=372820&start=25)

I will try using AI to generate the script.

## Power
The Power comes from the Power Bank, in my case.
The Power bank also provied power for Pi Zero W.
