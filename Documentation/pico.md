# The Pi Pico H
The Pi Pico H, in my case, will be a Bare Metal development environment. I will test Assembly Scripts on it, as long as emulators and other cool stuff.

## Tool
To control it, I use  [MicroREPL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=micro.repl.ma7moud3ly&hl=en&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dmicrorepl+play+store&pcampaignid=APPU_1_e3GdZpuCF9eD9u8P26GZgAQ), [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) and VS Code.
